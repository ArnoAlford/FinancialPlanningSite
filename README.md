Tortfolio is a simple but effective portfolio balancing calculator written as a way to give back to the reddit financial community. The calculator takes your current financial situation, holdings in Domestic, bonds and international stocks, and finds the most tax-optimal fund placement to get to your desired asset allocation. It addition to this, the site offers support for rollovers, expected future accounts, and past contributions. It is my hope that this app helps people save money, and proves to be an open-source free alternative in a market of only paid resources.
